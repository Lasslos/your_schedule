# your_schedule - Stundenplan

Filter your Untis Schedule by classes you have chosen.

### How it works

I reverse-engineered the Untis-Mobile App and created a Flutter App that does the same thing,
with an important addition: It asks you what classes you are signed up for, and filters the
timetable accordingly.

### Pull requests and Issues

are welcome, if your school also uses Untis but does not filter the classes for their students,
this app should work for you too. If it doesn't, file an issue!
