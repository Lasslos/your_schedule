### Documentation

I documented the whole process in my thesis, which you can find on
my [website](https://laslo-hauschild.eu/facharbeit/Facharbeit.pdf).
Note that this document is in German. Basically, I reverse-engineered the Untis API with HTTP-Toolkit and wrote a
Flutter app to display the data.

### Testing

If your school uses Untis and doesn't provide individual credentials, I'd be glad to support you to get the app running
for you school as well!
It should, in theory, already work, but you never know. If you need credentials to test the app yourself, please contact
me.

Pull requests and issues are always welcome.
